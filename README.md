## üëãüèª New AI Assistant UI for Teams, Groups, or Families

A new ChatBot UI Front-End indended to provide Pay-as-you-Go access to best AI LLM models for small teams or private groups (families).

Focuses on reduced complexity, easy selection of best supported models (currently by OpenAI and Anthropic) for each new chat.

Server-side handling of API Keys (coming from Environment Variables), and basic logging (for usage analysis, who used how much).

Currently made for deployment into an Azure Container App with Azure AD Authentication, but that may evolve soon.

Originally based on "BetterChatGPT" project by Jing Hua (https://github.com/ztjhz/BetterChatGPT), but at this point it was significantly modified with little possibility to merge upstream.

# üî• Features

- Currently supports OpenAI and Anthropic models; Anthropic models support is configurable (can be enabled or disabled).
- Server-Side Proxy to secure the API keys, and implement basic usage logging (only metadata, not conversations content)
- Basic support for Azure AD authentication by Azure Container Apps: logout button, authentication redirect on session expiration.
- Prompt Library
- Dark Mode
- Add Clarification button to quickly amending the previous message (instead of lengtherning the thread)
- Organize chats into folders (with colours), filter chats and folders
- Keeps track and displays tokens count and pricing estimates
- Quick model selection window for new chats (with hotkeys)
- Chat title generation (uses GPT-3.5 or Haiku)
- Chats, and unsent message drafts are automatically persisted to browser's local storage
- Import / Export
- Download chat (markdown, json, PNG)
- Multiple language support (i18n) -> currently narrowed down to English and Russian
    (other languages i18n existed in the upstream project, but these translations were not maintained with fork changes)

Features that existed in the original project, but were hidden or removed
- Conversation publishing to ShareGPT - removed for privacy considerations
- Conversations sync to Google Drive  - removed for privacy considerations
- Advanced options to edit the thread such as rearranging the messages, changing roles, etc. There was no obvious business use-case, it looked complex, and did not play well with Anthropic.

# üõ†Ô∏è Deployment to Azure

   ```
   ... TBD (docker build, push to ACR, create an Azure Container App)
   ... TBD (Azure AD Authentication for ACR App)
   ... TBD (Azure Log Analytics with Data Collection Endpoint for logging)
   ```
